Welcome to my page! I'm @epoliszuk / Ellis, and I'm a student/hobbyist.

I prefer they/them pronouns, but anything works!

I'm interested in art, math, and computer science! With art, I mainly do traditional pen on paper. I plan to learn Blender, though! With math, I know calculus, but mainly I'm interested in number/set/field theory. I also have years of experience with Python, and have some knowledge in C#.

The content posted here will either be personal projects I feel are fleshed out enough to publish or projects I decided to polish in order to release.
